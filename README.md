# ProtMap <br>
Project made for an internship at the University of Cincinnati, supervised by Dr. Jarek Meller <br>

# About project <br>

## main.py script <br>
This script provides most of the data used for generating embeddings and umap in scripts in `embGen.py` and `ProtMap.py`. <br>
All of the data is already generated in the repo in folders: `classes` , `pdbs` and `fastas`
Running the script will regenerate all of the data needed using `rcsb` database and `pdb101`, they are necessary for running the rest of the scripts.

### Prerequisites <br>
To run this script you will need to issue this command:
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install bs4
  python ./main.py

## embGen.py script <br>
This script can be used to generate embeddings stored in `.h5` files used for generating UMap. This script utilize `ProstT5` model for generating protein embeddings. For each `fasta` file it will generate an embedding for the first chain in the file. All of the embeddings are already generated for the files in `fasta` folder in `embeddings`.

### Prerequisites <br>
To run this script you will nedd to issue this commands:
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install transformers
  pip install torch
  pip install h5py
  python ./embGen.py

## ProtMap.py script <br>
This is the main script of this project. It will generate a UMap of the protien embeddings generated by `embGen.py` script and will display interactive scatter plot. Each point can be right-clicked and a pop-up will show up containing name of the protein as well as it's visualization generated by `pymol`. To exit the pop-up press `close popup`, exiting by clicking X may generate some issues. Each point will have a color corresponding to architecture of the protein that it represents. Visualizations of these proteins are already generated in folder `pngs` to regenerate them uncomment line `94` with `generate_png()`
